# PluginCore

Welcome to PluginCore, a plugin made by Zeao (As a part of the VMPE Development team.) Now, you are probably wondering what this plugin does, and the point of this plugin.

Well, this plugin allows you to have more than 1 Plugin-Side all in one core, so no need to worry how much plugins you have on your server, when you can have "Most plugins" all in one plugin-core. Which reduces CPU, and what not. This is probably the only core which allows multiple plugins in one.
## KEEP IN MIND - I am not copying these plugins involved in the core. I am simply adding them into the core. This could be useful for: Updating plugin codes, Fixing outdated codes, plugins in general, and more. If you want a plugin you think we should add onto the core itself, then please open a new issue. We'll be glad to try and add them in if possible.
